# Workflow State

## State
- Phase: VALIDATE
- Status: COMPLETED
- Current Epic: Sentry Integration for Advanced Error Tracking

## Plan

### Comprehensive Sentry Integration Implementation

**Current State Analysis:**
- ✅ Sentry SDK already installed (v2.34.1)
- ✅ Basic Sentry initialization exists
- ✅ Comprehensive local logging system implemented
- ❌ Missing advanced Sentry configuration
- ❌ No Sentry integration with existing logging
- ❌ No performance monitoring setup
- ❌ No custom Sentry context and tags

**Detailed Implementation Steps:**

1. **Enhanced Sentry Configuration (settings.py)**
   - Configure advanced Sentry options (environment, release, integrations)
   - Add Django, Celery, Redis, and Logging integrations
   - Set up performance monitoring and profiling
   - Configure custom error filtering and sampling
   - Add environment-specific configurations

2. **Create Sentry Utilities Library (lib/sentry_utils.py)**
   - Custom Sentry context managers
   - Business context tagging functions
   - Custom fingerprinting for error grouping
   - Performance transaction decorators
   - Custom breadcrumb functions

3. **Integrate Sentry with Existing Logging System**
   - Enhance middleware to send errors to Sentry
   - Update logging_utils.py to include Sentry context
   - Add Sentry tags to security events
   - Connect Celery task failures to Sentry

4. **Update Application Modules**
   - Add Sentry context to authentication flows (account module)
   - Add performance monitoring to business operations (post module)
   - Add custom tags for different user types and operations
   - Integrate with existing error handling

5. **Advanced Error Tracking Features**
   - Set up custom error grouping
   - Configure release tracking
   - Add user context to all Sentry events
   - Set up performance monitoring for critical paths

6. **Documentation and Testing**
   - Update architecture documentation
   - Create Sentry monitoring guide
   - Test error reporting and performance tracking
   - Verify integration with existing logging

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Real-time error tracking and alerting
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Enhanced debugging with user context
- Centralized error management dashboard
- Improved production monitoring

## Rules
- Follow existing logging patterns and enhance them
- Maintain backward compatibility with current logging
- Ensure Sentry integration doesn't affect performance
- Use environment-specific configurations
